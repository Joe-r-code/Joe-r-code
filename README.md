Hello and welcome,

This is a github page for my projects.

I am genomics researcher, focusing on multiomics data.

I am interested in big data, machine learning, AI and bioinformatics.

I focus my research on the microbiome and medical Cannabis (which is now legal in the UK on private prescription)

if you're interested in getting involved in some genomics research I have a project to create a new dna file format that includes base modifications, please look at.my projects page. Feel free just to comment, feedback is much appreciated.
