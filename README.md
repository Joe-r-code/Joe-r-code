This is a github page for my projects.

I am genomics researcher, focusing on multiomics data.

I am interested in big data, machine learning, AI and bioinformatics.

I focus my research on the microbiome (or metagenomics, I just like bacteria) and medical Cannabis (which is now legal in the UK on private prescription)

if you're interested in getting involved in some genomics research I have a project to create a new nucleic acid file format that includes base modifications, please look at my projects page. Feel free just to comment, feedback is much appreciated.

Making a new file format is simply a starting point but I feel that genomic sequence data shouldn't be divided into many file formats, at least not until further analysis is conducted.
